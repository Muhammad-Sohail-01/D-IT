                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Payment is due within 24 hours of the invoice date, except for Corporate Accounts, where it has been
                    agreed upon in writing.
                    <br/>
                    The customer is responsible for ensuring that the invoice is accurate and complete and for notifying

                    <br/>
                    EVS reserves the right to suspend or terminate services if payment is not received within the
                    specified time frame.
                    <br/>
                    The customer agrees to indemnify and hold EVS harmless from any claims, damages, or expenses arising
                    from the customer's use of the services provided.
                    <br/>
                    Any disputes arising from this invoice or the services provided will be subject to mediation and, if
                    necessary, legal action.
                    <br/>
                    EVS reserves the right to modify these terms and conditions at any time, and the customer will be
                    bound by the terms in effect at the time of invoice issuance.

                    All materials and intellectual property created or provided by EVS in connection with the services

                        <li>The owner of the vehicle or his/her representative agrees that all valuable and personal
                            items have been removed from the vehicle, and any personal valuables that remain in the
                            vehicle shall only be the responsibility of the vehicle owner or his/her representative. EVS
                            shall not be responsible for the loss or damage of any personal valuables left in the
                            vehicle.
                        </li>
                        <li>In case of an accident while the customer's vehicle is under EVS custody or on a road test,
                            EVS's responsibility is limited only to repairing any damage resulting from any accident
                            back to the condition in which the vehicle was received. The vehicle's owner or his/her
                            representative accepts and waives the right to demand a replacement car or claim any
                            compensation for losses resulting from any accidents.
                        </li>
                        <li>Estimates for the cost of repairs are only valid if, in writing, the Customer authorizes EVS
                            without delay and EVS agrees to undertake the work.
                        </li>
                        <li>The estimates will cover only the items and labour explicitly stated in the estimate and do
                            not cover the cost of any additional items that may be requested or required from either
                            Party. The Customer consents that EVS may dismantle any part of the vehicle that may be
                            required to effect the agreed repair or service work and hereby agrees to pay for the cost
                            of the required dismantling and reassembly.
                        </li>

                        </li>
                        <li>EVS agrees to warrant the repairs to the vehicle in line with the Manufacturer's Warranty
                            terms and conditions. Parts purchased and fitted by EVS outside of any Vehicle Warranty
                            scope will be warranted for a period of 3 months from the date of installation. Mechanical
                            and Suspension parts are excluded. EVS will not warrant parts that have been fitted or
                            tampered with outside of an EVS branch.
                        </li>
                        <li>The company reserves the right to subcontract any or all of the agreed work. All parts
                            replaced by EVS will be retained and disposed of by EVS, unless the Customer requests in
                            writing at the time of vehicle handover to EVS to receive the replaced parts. In this case,
                            the replaced parts must be collected at the time of vehicle collection. All parts replaced
                            under the scope of a Manufacturer's or official EVS Warranty must be retained by EVS for
                            warranty purposes.
                        </li>
                        <li>The Customer hereby authorizes EVS to store the vehicle at EVS's or its Sub-contractors
                            premises, at the Customer's risk, to test-drive, to drive the vehicle to and from EVS
                            premises, and between EVS and EVS's sub-contractors premises.
                        </li>
                        <li>Delivery and Collection of the vehicle should take place at EVS premises. Alternative
                            arrangements must be agreed by an EVS Representative and may be undertaken at the exclusive
                            risk of the Customer. All payments for work undertaken must be made at EVS premises.
                        </li>
                        <li>The vehicle should be collected within <strong>two (2) days from the date of
                            completion
                        </strong> of the
                            agreed work or a non-agreement on the repair estimate. Any delay beyond this point will
                            incur a daily charge of AED100 charged every day, for vehicle storage as well as any
                            additional expenses. Storage in this manner will be undertaken at the exclusive risk of the
                            Customer.
